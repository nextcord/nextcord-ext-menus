# Contributing to nextcord-ext-menus

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. It makes the library substantially better. :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the repository. These are guidelines, not hard rules.

## This is too much to read! I want to ask a question

Generally speaking questions are better suited in our resources below.

- The official support server: <https://discord.gg/ZebatWssCB>
- The Discord API server under #python_discord-py: <https://discord.gg/discord-api>
- [The FAQ in the documentation](https://nextcord.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)
- [StackOverflow's `nextcord` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nextcord)
- [StackOverflow's `discord.py` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/discord.py)
- [The discussions page](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/discussions)

Please try your best not to ask questions in our issue tracker. Most of them don't belong there unless they provide value to a larger audience.

## Good Bug Reports

Please be aware of the following things when filing bug reports.

1. Don't open duplicate issues. Please search your issue to see if it has been asked already. Duplicate issues will be closed.
2. When filing a bug about exceptions or tracebacks, please include the *complete* traceback. Without the complete traceback the issue might be **unsolvable** and you will be asked to provide more information.
3. Make sure to provide enough information to make the issue workable. The issue template will generally walk you through the process but they are enumerated here as well:
    - A **summary** of your bug report. This is generally a quick sentence or two to describe the issue in human terms.
    - Guidance on **how to reproduce the issue**. Ideally, this should have a small code sample that allows us to run and see the issue for ourselves to debug. **Please make sure that the token is not displayed**. If you cannot provide a code snippet, then let us know what the steps were, how often it happens, etc.
    - Tell us **what you expected to happen**. That way we can meet that expectation.
    - Tell us **what actually happens**. What ends up happening in reality? It's not helpful to say "it fails" or "it doesn't work". Say *how* it failed, do you get an exception? Does it hang? How are the expectations different from reality?
    - Tell us **information about your environment**. What version of nextcord and nextcord-ext-menus are you using? How was it installed? What operating system are you running on? These are valuable questions and information that we use.

If the bug report is missing this information then it'll take us longer to fix the issue. We will probably ask for clarification, and barring that if no response was given then the issue will be closed.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Submitting a pull request is fairly simple, just make sure it focuses on a single aspect and doesn't manage to have scope creep and it's probably good to go. It would be incredibly lovely if the style is consistent to that found in the project. This project follows PEP-8 guidelines (mostly) with a column limit of 100. `black` will use the `pyproject.toml` located in the root of the project to determine the style settings.

It would be nice if the code is formatted with no type-checking issues before submitting a PR. To make sure, install the tools using `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` (or poetry etc), and follow these steps:

- To format the code, run `pre-commit run` once your files are staged, or `task lint` to fix all files.
Alternatively, run `task precommit` to install hooks to run all checks when you commit (see the [pre-commit docs](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start)).
**Note:** If the code is formatted incorrectly, `pre-commit` will fix and exit without committing - just stage and commit again.
- For type-checks, run `task pyright` (or `task pyright -w` to check every file edit)
**Note:** If you're using VSCode and pylance, it will use the same settings, which generally means that you don't have to run pyright. However, there can be version conflicts which may give different results when ran in CI on GitHub.

### Git Commit Guidelines

- Use present tense (e.g. "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Limit all lines to 72 characters or less.
- When linking issues/prs please use the shorthand `#123` and not the full URL.

If you do not meet any of these guidelines, don't fret. Chances are they will be fixed upon rebasing but please do try to meet them to remove some of the workload.
